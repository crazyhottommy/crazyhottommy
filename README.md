### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I have over 10 years of computational biology experience, 6 years of molecular cancer biology and 4 years of immunology experience. 
* I am a computational biologist working on (single-cell) genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics. 
* I use machine learning approaches to find new drug targets for cancer patients;
* I use google cloud and Terra for large scale data processing;
* I use R primary for data wrangling and visualization in the tidyverse ecosystem; 
* I use python for writing Snakemake workflows and reformatting data; 
* I am a unix geek learning shell tricks almost every month; I care about reproducible research and open science.
