### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I am a computational biologist working on (single-cell) genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics. 
* I use R primary for data wrangling and visualization in the tidyverse ecosystem; 
* I use python for writing Snakemake workflows and reformatting data; 
* I am a unix geek learning shell tricks almost every month; I care about reproducible research and open science.
